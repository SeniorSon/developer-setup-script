# Developer setup script
This is a PowerShell script to automate the setup of a local developer environment using WSL2 and Visual Studio Code.
This script checks if WSL2 and VSCode are installed, sets up the necessary configurations, installs a Linux distribution in WSL2 (e.g., Ubuntu), 
and installs some common developer tools like Git and Node.js within the WSL2 environment.

Note: Before running this script, ensure that you're running it with adminstrator privileges since it will install and configure system components.
